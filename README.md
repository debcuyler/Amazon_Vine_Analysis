# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview
I have been asked to analyze reviews from the Amazon Vine program. This program is a service that allows manufacturers to receive reviews for their products. The company pays a small fee and then provides products to Amazon Vine members for review. This project is to assess if there is bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.

## Results
Dataframes were created and filtered based on whether or not is was a paid Vine review



- There were 170 Vine reviews and 37840 non-Vine reviews
- There were 65 Vine 5-star reviews and 20612 non-Vine 5-star reviews
- 38% of the Vine reviews were 5-star and 54% of the non-Vine reviews were 5-star

## Summary
In summary, there seems to be no bias in the number of 5-star reviews given by Vine members. They actually review a bit harsher than the non-Vine reviewers, with only 38% of their reviews being 5-star compared to 54% in the non-Vine review group. I would like to also run an analysis that compares the 5-star votes between Vine and non-Vine reviews on the same product. This may give a clearer picture.
